  Read a csv table into a list of named tuples

  filename:       csv file to read from
  rownameorclass: class that will represent each row, to be called
                  with **kwargs with the keywords based on the column
                  headers.  Alternatively you can give a name, and a
                  dataclass will be automatically created with that name.
  columntypes:    type (or function) to be called on each element in
                  that column.  Default is it's just left as a string.

  Example:
    table.csv contains
      ID,x,y
      A,1,3
      B,2,4.5

    If you call
      table = readtable("table.csv", "Point", x=float, y=float)
    you will get
      [
        Point(ID="A", x=1.0, y=3.0),
        Point(ID="B", x=2.0, y=4.5),
      ]
    where Point is a class created specially for this table.

    You can access the column values through table[0].ID (= "A")
    or table[1][1] (= 2.0)
