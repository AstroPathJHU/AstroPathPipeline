# 4.4.4. Control TMA Conventions
Each staining batch should be stained with a control TMA. The control TMAs are used to:
- assess the quality of staining performed on a given staining run
- normalize the data as part of the database upload
When scanning the slides should be named *Control_TMA_XXXX_ZZ_MM.DD.YYYY*
- XXXX is the TMA ID
-	ZZ is the TMA cut number
-	MM.DD.YYYY is the month, day, and year of staining
*NOTE*: The ‘Control’ designation is provided so that we can appropriately select and handle the control tissues automatically
