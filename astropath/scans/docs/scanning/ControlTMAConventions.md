# 4.4.4. Control TMA Conventions
Each staining batch should be stained with a control TMA. The control TMAs are used to assess the quality of staining performed on a given staining run, and normalize the data as part of the database upload.

When scanning the slides should be named *Control_TMA_XXXX_ZZ_MM.DD.YYYY*
- **XXXX** is the TMA ID
-	**ZZ** is the TMA cut number
-	**MM.DD.YYYY** is the month, day, and year of staining
*NOTE*: The ‘Control’ designation is provided so that we can appropriately select and handle the control tissues automatically
