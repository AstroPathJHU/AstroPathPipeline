# 4.4.5.2. Preparing 20% Overlap
As part of the AstroPath Pipeline, slides must be scanned with fields that overlap by 20%. We use this overlap to measure and/ or correct for errors in imagery, including warping, illumination, segmentation, and positioning. This is step should be performed on each computer that will be used to create scanning plans in *Phenochart(C)*. The changes made are permant and should only need to be performed once for a computer.
1. Install the lastest version of *Phenochart(C)*
2. Be sure that *Phenochart(C)* is shut down
3. Go to *C:\ProgramData\PerkinElmer\Phenochart\* (Please note that ProgramData is usually a hidden folder)
4. Copy and paste the *Phenochart.config* file with one that does 20% overlap (a version of this is located in this folder)
5. Check ‘ROIs with overlap’ as on under the settings in *Phenochart(C)*
