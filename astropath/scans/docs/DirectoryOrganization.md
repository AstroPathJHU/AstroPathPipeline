# 4.6. Directory Organization
## 4.6.1. Directory Subfolders
The following folders are located in the ```<Dpath>\<Dname>``` folder and are intialized by the code for the *AstroPath Pipeline*. The most interesting folders for typical users are the ```upkeep_and_progress``` and the ```tmp_inform_data``` folders.

1.	```upkeep_and_progress```
    - For any upkeep and progress tracking files
    - Location of the *AstropathAPIDdef_PP.csv* files, where ```PP``` indicates the numeric project id
2.	```flatfield```
    - Location of the flatfield parameter files
    - These files are named ```Flatfield_BatchID_BB.bin```, replacing the ```BB``` for the appropriate batch id.
3.	```logfiles```
    - Project level log files for the astropath pipeline 
4.	```Batch```
    - The batch and merge tables
    - These tables are described in further documentation located [here](scanning/BatchTables.md) and [here](scanning/MergeConfigTables.md) respectively
5.	```Clinical```
    - Location of the clinical table
    - These tables should be labeled as *Clinical_Table_Specimen_CSID_MMDDYYYY.csv*, where the ```CSID``` indicates the number on the ```<Dname>``` folder. 
    - We always use the clinical table with the most recent date in the data upload
6.	```Ctrl```
    - Location of control TMA data output
7.	```dbload```
    - Location of the files used for the database upload
8.	```tmp_inform_data```
    - Location of the inform data output and inform algorithms used. **Additional information on this folder is provided in the hpf processing documentation.**
9.	```reject```
    - Location of the rejected slides

## 4.6.2. SlideID Subfolders
The following is the directory structure for each ```<SlideID>``` in the *AstroPath Pipeline* in the ```<Dpath>\<Dname>``` folders. The code initializes most of the folders if running the pipeline from the beginning and places data in the proper locations. 

*NOTE*: ```<>``` indicate variables, lines without brackets indicate full names
