"""
The units module provides an interface for dealing with distances, which
are sometimes saved in units of pixels and sometimes in units of microns.
It has three modes: safe, fast_pixels, and fast_microns.  (fast is an alias
for fast_pixels.)

When running in safe mode, all distances are saved as Distance objects,
and the dimensions are checked when doing math with them.  When running in
fast_pixels or fast_microns mode, distances are saved as numbers, with the
convention 1 pixel = 1 or 1 micron = 1, respectively.

All modes are designed to produce the same output results.  In practice,
safe mode is only needed for testing.  When running modules, fast_pixels
or fast_microns should usually be equivalent, but in computation-heavy
processes one or the other might be faster.
