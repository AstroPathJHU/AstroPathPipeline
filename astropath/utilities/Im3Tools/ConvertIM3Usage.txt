
ConvertIM3 Usage


0.  Overview

The ConvertIM3 application reads and writes AKOYA IM3 ("image cube") files.

ConvertIM3 uses a simple set of C# classes to represent the contents of an IM3 file.
Unfortunately, the IM3 format is undocumented. There are no software tools available that
manage IM3 files directly.  It is more practical to transform IM3 into a well-known format
that can be handled by generally-available software.  Since the IM3 format is essentially
a hierarchy of self-described groups of data, a straightforward way to work with IM3 is to
convert it to and from XML.

ConvertIM3 can carry out the following operations:

- convert IM3 to XML
- convert XML to IM3
- extract one IM3 data field (that is, one XML element) from IM3-formatted data
- replace the contents of one IM3 data field (that is, one XML element) in IM3-formatted data


1. Command-line syntax

   ConvertIM3 <input_file_specification> IM3|XML|DAT
              [/o <output_directory_path>] 
              [/t <max_XML_data_length>] 
              [/x <XPath_expression>]
              [/i <injected_data_file_specification>]

1.1. Convert IM3 to XML

ConvertIM3 <IM3_file_specification> XML [/o <output_directory_path>] [/t <max_XML_data_length>]

- IM3_file_specification is a fully-qualified path and filename for an IM3-formatted file. The input
  file's extension should be .im3.
- XML indicates the output format.
- /o [optional] specifies the path into which the XML file is written. 
- /t [optional] limits the amount of data written in any single XML element. If the length in bytes of
  the data in an XML element exceeds the value specified with the /t parameter, ConvertIM3 writes an
  XML "placeholder" comment instead of the actual data.  (IM3 contains image bitmaps whose multi-
  megabyte size makes it inconvenient to visualize the XML.  A reasonably-chosen value for /t excludes
  these BLOBs from the XML without affecting other data.)

The XML filename is the same as the input filename, but with a .xml extension.

1.2. Convert XML to IM3

ConvertIM3 <XML_file_specification> IM3 [/o <output_directory_path>]

- XML_file_specification is a fully-qualified path and filename for an XML-formatted file.  The input
  file's extension should be .xml.
- IM3 indicates the output format.
- /o [optional] specifies the path into which the IM3 file is written. The IM3 filename is the same as
  the input filename, but with a .im3 extension.

1.3. Extract a data field as XML or DAT (binary data) from an IM3 or XML file.

ConvertIM3 <input_file_specification> XML|DAT /x <XPath_expression> [/o <output_directory_path>]

- input_file_specification is a fully-qualified path and filename for an IM3- or XML-formatted file.
- XML or DAT indicates the output format.
- /o [optional] specifies the path into which the output file is written. The output filename is the
  same as the input filename, but with an .xml or .dat extension.
- /x limits output to the XML elements specified in an XPath expression. For example,
    /x .//G[@name='TimeStamp'] writes the following XML to the output file:

    <IM3Fragment>
      <G name="TimeStamp">20170611T233655.022</G>
    </IM3Fragment>

  When you specify an XPath query that selects only data, the results of the query are emitted to
  console output instead of the XML file.  For example, /x .//G[@name='TimeStamp']/text() generates
  the following output
    
    ConvertIM3 v1.0.6714.27251

    . . .
    20170611T233655.022
    ConvertIM3 ends

  Finally, when you use an XPath query that selects only data, and you also specify DAT as the output
  format, ConvertIM3 writes binary data to a .dat file:

    Offset(d) 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15
    00000000  32 30 31 37 30 36 31 31 54 32 33 33 36 35 35 2E  20170611T233655.
    00000016  30 32 32                                         022

  This may be the most convenient way to transfer data such as an image bitmap from IM3 to an application
  that can read the binary data as it is formatted within IM3.

1.4. Inject a data field as XML or DAT (binary data) into an XML file.

ConvertIM3 <XML_file_specification> XML|IM3 /x <XPath_expression> /i <injected_data_file_specification> [/o <output_directory_path>]

- input_file_specification is a fully-qualified path and filename for an XML-formatted file.
- XML or IM3 indicates the output format.
- /o [optional] specifies the path into which the output file is written. The output filename is the
  same as the input filename, but with an .xml or .dat extension.
- /x is an XPath expression that specifies the XML element whose data content is replaced by the content of
  the specified data file.  The XPath expression must specify a unique data element in the XML file.  For example,
    
  Examples:
    .//G[@name='TimeStamp']/text() uniquely specifies the XML data element that contains the "TimeStamp" string.
    .//D[@name='Thumbnail']/text() uniquely specifies the "Thumbnail" image bitmap.
    .//D[@name='Data']/text() uniquely specifies the main image bitmap.
