# ConvertIm3
The ConvertIm3 executable was written by Richard Wilton to extract\ inject the bitmap and metadata information from the akoya im3 image files. ConvertIm3Path is a powershell code, added by Benjamin Green, and is a soft wrapper for the executable to run on the sample level, with optional inputs and exports. Both codes are dependent on the images being in the AstropathPipeline directory format which is slightly different than the standard Akoya imagery directory format. ConvertIm3Cohort.ps1 is a wrapper for ConvertIm3Path.ps1 which runs through all specimens in a directory, the cohort is hard coded at present and should be modified in the code. All parameters for the ps1 codes are described in the code body, the Usage.txt is for CovertIm3.exe.
