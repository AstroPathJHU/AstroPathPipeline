::
:: Fix all filenames that were created due to an error.
:: In these cases the original .im3 file has been truncated,
:: it exists but cannot be used. The Vectra system then
:: re-wrote the file, but padded the filename with _M2.
:: Here we do two things: if there is an _M2 file, we first
:: delete the file with the short length, then rename the file.
