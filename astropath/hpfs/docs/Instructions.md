Usually the code is launched and monitored by one person. Most of the user interaction in the pipeline for those not running the code will be with the ```<upkeep_and_progress>``` subfolder in the ```<Dpath>\<Dname>``` directory, the ```<QA_QC>``` subfolders in the specimen directories, and the ```<Project_Development>``` folder [4.6.](../../scans/docs/DirectoryOrganization.md#46-directory-organization).
