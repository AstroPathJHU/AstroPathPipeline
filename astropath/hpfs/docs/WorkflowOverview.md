# 5.4 Workflow Overview
As noted above, modules outside of ```segmaps``` and ```transferanno``` can be launched and allowed to run continuously. These steps outline how a slide might process through the workflow. 

1. Update the AstroPath files in the <mpath>
2. Update the slides in the *Specimen_Table_N.xlsx*
3. Scan the slides according to the documentation in [4.](../scans/#scans "Title")
4. Launch the ```AstroIDGen``` module to intialize the slides into the pipeline
5. Launch the ```TransferDeamon``` module to start transferring completed slides from the <Spath> location to the ```<Dpath>\<Dname>```
6. Launch the ```meanimages``` module to create mean images of each slide as it finishes transferring; these will be used to build the batch flatfields.
7. Launch the ```flatw_queue``` module to create the flatfields and assign new slides to the flatw_queue. Then the module distributes flatw jobs to the assigned workers.
8. Launch the ```flatw_worker``` module on the assigned worker machine to process the flatfielding and image warping corrections on a particular slide's hpf image set
9. Create the BatchID and MergeConfig files for the project according to documentation in scans
10. Launch the ```mergeloop``` module to initialize necessary antibody processing folders, create the local inform_queue for a project, recieve inform results, merge the data and create qa qc images to evaluate the inform classification algorithms.
11. Create phenotype algorithms in inForm according to the protocol established **here**
12. Launch the ```inform_queue``` module to send jobs from the main inform queue to the queues on the inform worker machines.
13. Launch the ```inform_worker``` module to process algorithms in inform
14. wait for QC images to process by the ```mergeloop``` module
    - evaluate the qc by the protocols established **here**
    -repeat 11-13 as needed
15. Launch ```segmaps``` module after qc has been completed for the cell classification of slides in a project to build the final segmenation maps.
16. Launch ```transferanno``` module after the slides have been successfully annotated in HALO and annotations have been exported to a desired location.
17. complete the final checklist located **here**

- ```AstroIDGen``` should be launched on the <Spath> location.  
- The following modules can be launched with **hpfs_main** at the same time: ```TransferDeamon```, ```meanimages```, ```flatw_queue```, ```inform_queue```, ```mergeloop```. 
- The following modules must be launched on their respective "worker" locations: ```flatw_worker``` and ```inform_worker```. 
- Launching segmaps runs over the entire set of projects but is not a continous loop and must be restarted to reprocess
- transferanno is a simple script that distributes and renames the halo annotations from a single folder to corresponding slide folders in a single project folder
