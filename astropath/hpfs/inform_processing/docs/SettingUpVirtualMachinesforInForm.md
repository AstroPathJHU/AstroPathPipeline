# 5.10.5. Setting Up Virtual Machines for InForm Farm
## 5.10.5.1. Description
The virtual machines should be set up with input from an IT professional. Use Hyper-V with Windows to set up virtual machines in order to ensure compatibilty with the *AstroPathPipeline* *inform_processing* module, [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/about/) is a link to windows Hyper-V Introduction page. Once the virtual machine is created, install a windows OS and add network capabilities. You can then install and activate InForm as on a normal computer. Be sure that you only log into the virtual machine using the Hyper-V Manager or through a screen mirroring server like TightVNC or RealVNC (using the Hyper-V Manager method will yield the best results). **Never use a windows remote desktop session, this will corrupt the InForm license.** Logging in using these screen mirroring techniques allows us to use the virtual machines as normal computers and still only allows one InForm session to be active at a time which should not violate the licensing agreement. However, please still consult Akoya Bioscience's and their documentation as this may change.
