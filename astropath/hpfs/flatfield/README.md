# 5.5. Flatfield

## 5.5.1. Description
The `flatfield` subworkflow provides routines to create meanimages for single samples, find the sets of samples that should be combined into flatfield correction models (`meanimagecomparison`), and create those flatfield correction models (`batchflatfield`). It also provides some code to double-check the efficacy of applying the determined flatfield corrections within a cohort.
